# K-Fold



Language: Python



**KFold.py**: Main Program to implement the K-Fold

**test.py:** apply datasets to test the program



K-Fold is implemented for two cases. One is the ideal situation that number of samples are the same in each class. And the other is when the number of samples are different. To applying the K-Fold method to the second case, I implement the algorithm in python.
