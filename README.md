# K-Fold



Language: Python



**KFold.py**: Main Program to implement the K-Fold

**test.py:** apply datasets to test the program



K-Fold is implemented for two cases. One is the ideal situation that number of samples are the same in each class. And the other is when the number of samples are different. To applying the K-Fold method to the second case, I implement the algorithm in python.


对python一直停留在用什么查什么的阶段，也不知道这么写会不会很冗余。测试结果需要，写了一个比较灵活的K-Fold,希望之后也能摆脱懒癌，陆陆续续整理一些别的出来。 -L-
